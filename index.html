<article> Going into my eighth grade year I got a few of my friends together and 
  we lifted almost everyday we also stared working on our plays to get us ready for the season. 
  I did not want to only win two games again. This is when I started to become a hard worker for football. 
  On the very last game of the year I hit someone and put my head down. 
  I compressed a disc in my neck and was rushed to the hospital I thought my Football days were over. 
  After basketball I decided not to play football my freshman year or so I thought. 
  My friend Anthony’s dad came and talked to me one on one. He explained to me that if I didn’t play then 
  I would be letting my team mates down and in the long run my school. 
  I decided to keep playing. Going into my freshman year I thought I knew what football was all about, boy was I wrong. 
I thought hard work was lifting a little, running a little, and doing some plays. 
In high-school we started speed training at six in the morning for two hours and 
then lifted for two hours after speed training, the older kids would go back in the evening to lift some more.
